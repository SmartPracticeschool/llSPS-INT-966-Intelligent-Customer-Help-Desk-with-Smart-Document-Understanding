Older people, and those with underlying medical problems are at a higher risk of developing serious illness.\nThe symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to those of the flu (influenza) or the common cold, which are a lot more prevalent. This is why testing is required to confirm that someone has COVID-19. Like other Coronaviruses, the Novel Coronavirus, too, is transmitted through direct contact with respiratory droplets of an infected person (generated through coughing and sneezing), and touching surfaces contaminated with the virus. \n"

The virus is referred to as 2019 Novel Coronavirus or 2019-nCoV. The2019-nCoV is a part of the same family of viruses as the ones which cause Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and even some types of the common cold. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic. Characterising COVID-19 as a pandemic is not an indication that the virus has become deadlier.
